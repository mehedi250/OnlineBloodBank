                <h3>Donating Blood by Compatible Type:</h3>
                <p>Blood types are very important when a blood transfusion is necessary. In a blood transfusion, a patient must receive a blood type compatible with his or her own blood type. If the blood types are not compatible, red blood cells will clump together, making clots that can block blood vessels and cause death.</p>
                <p>If two different blood types are mixed together, the blood cells may begin to clump together in the blood vessels, causing a potentially fatal situation. Therefore, it is important that blood types be matched before blood transfusions take place. In an emergency, type O blood can be given because it is most likely to be accepted by all blood types. However, there is still a risk involved.</p>

            <p>Donating blood for the first time? Been awhile since you made your last donation? Unsure of what to do? Here are some pointers on how you can prepare for your blood donation.</p>
            <h4>Before your donation</h4>
            <ul>
                    <li>Eat a light meal and drink plenty of fluids before your donation.</li>
                    <li>Ensure you get adequate rest the night before your donation and on the actual day itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What to bring</h4>
            <ul>
                    <li>Official photo identity document (e.g. passport, IC, driving license, donor card) with a local residential address</li>
                    <li>Signed Parental consent form (if you are 16 or 17 years old)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Process</h2>
            <p >The whole donation process involves really simple steps and takes an average of 45 minutes to complete:</p>
            <p>1. Form Filling (5 mins)</p>
            <ul>
                    <li>Complete the health assessment questionnaire to determine your eligibility for donation. The completion of this questionnaire should be done in private as it is a personal statement of your medical and social history.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2. Registration (5 mins)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your personal particulars will be recorded and you will be placed in the donation queue.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>3. Medical Screening (10-15 mins)</p>
            <ul>
                    <li>A medical screener will go through your responses to the health assessment questionnaire with you and measure your weight, pulse, blood pressure and temperature to confirm you are fit for donation.</li>
